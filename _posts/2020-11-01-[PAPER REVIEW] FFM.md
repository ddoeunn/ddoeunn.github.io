Click-through rate(CTR) prediction plays an important role in computational advertising. This [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2959100.2959134?casa_token=2HFKgPvmUnQAAAAA:74DUN0wTfUgZu92OPlmGQsIpTlPVqJv7Dzjspa_ZMVJZ-k5j4e-Cw7hPzKusLJNY30O7VG8TXvcXCgI) establishes Field-aware Factorization Machines(FFM) as an effective method for classifying large sparse data including CTR prediction.


# **1. CTR dataset**
For most CTR datasets, features can be grouped into "field"
